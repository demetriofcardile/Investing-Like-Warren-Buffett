# Investing-Like-Warren-Buffett
This project aims to replicate and analyze Berkshire Hathaway's performance based on some of the results in Frazzini, Kabiller and Pedersen
(FAJ 2018), “Buffet’s Alpha”, henceforth FKP, using factor models and regression analysis. Data from AQR for risk factors and market price data for Berkshire Hathaway (downloaded from YFinance) will be utilized from 12/31/1999 onwards.

Key tasks include factor returns analysis, Sharpe and Information ratio computation, multivariate regression, Buffett-style portfolio construction, and systematic portfolio regressions.

Notice that this project has been developed together with other two collaborators (and fellow colleagues) as a group-project for a BSc Course in Computational Finance.
